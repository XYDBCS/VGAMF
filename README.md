Variational Graph Auto-Encoders and matrix factorization
============

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the (Variational) Graph Auto-Encoder and matrix factorization model for miRNA-disease associations prediction as described in our paper:

“Predicting miRNA-Disease Associations Based on Multi-View Variational Graph Auto-Encoder with Matrix Factorization”
